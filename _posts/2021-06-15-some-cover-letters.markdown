Some cover letters

Spotify has had a big impact on my daily life since it was released. The application is always running in the background when I train, work or relax. I feel that Spotify always contributes something to my days independently of what I'm currently up to. When I develop I want to feel that I help create a better everyday life for many people, which I believe Spotify does and that's why I'm writing this application.
I am a humble developer, I strive to keep my code transparent and easy to understand. To enable more people to be involved in what I create and also question my code. To come up with the best possible solution, I believe that continuous feedback is the key to success and the way to go. I think this fits well in how Spotify describes the way of working, which I believe I could contribute to.
When I develop I always strive to make the code more efficient and easy to manage. I'm a doer rather than a questioner when I code, I start by doing and learn from what I observe. I think this will make me fit well in a company like Spotify where you value people who are innovating, taking risks, and where people have no fear of failure.
I would be delighted to discuss the various ways in which I could contribute to your team. I look forward with excitement to hearing from you.
